A new drawing-style Real Time Strategy game. Based on the book by Brandon Sanderson, **The Rithmatist**, this game seeks to explore the world of line-based combat where players and enemies can draw (with their cursor) their defenses and minions.

The game will play similarly to Clash Royale and other fast-paced RTS games, with the twist that players are able to directly influence the battle and battlefield without minions; by drawing on it! Core features include being able to draw walls and obstacles that let you control the movement of minions in play. These obstacles are destructable, but players can influence minion behavior in their favor. Drawing can also be used offensively to attack enemy minions (but have little impact on the enemy base. Other features and gameplay mechanics are in consideration, but at present, development is focusing on just the basics of gameplay that I described above.
